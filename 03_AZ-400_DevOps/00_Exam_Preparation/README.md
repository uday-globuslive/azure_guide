   - Consider the scenario context
   - Eliminate obviously incorrect answers
   - Look for qualifiers (always, never, must, etc.)
   - Watch for "best practice" questions vs. technical possibility

3. **Case Studies**
   - Read the overview first
   - Understand the requirements and constraints
   - Take notes on key points
   - Reference the case study for each question

4. **Exam Environment**
