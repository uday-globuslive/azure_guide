# Azure Project Implementations

This section provides comprehensive, hands-on project implementations that integrate multiple Azure services to solve real-world business problems. Each project demonstrates the practical application of skills learned in the AZ-900, AZ-104, and AZ-400 training sections.

## Project Structure

Each project follows a consistent structure:
- **Architecture Overview**: Visual and textual description of the solution architecture
- **Business Requirements**: The problem statement and business needs addressed
- **Implementation Guide**: Step-by-step instructions for building the solution
- **Infrastructure as Code**: ARM templates or Bicep files for automated deployment
- **Monitoring and Management**: Guidelines for operating the solution
- **Cost Optimization**: Strategies for managing costs
- **Security Considerations**: Best practices for securing the implementation

## Available Projects

1. **Simple Web App**: Deploy a scalable web application with database backend
2. **Three-Tier Architecture**: Implement a traditional three-tier application in Azure
3. **Serverless Application**: Build an event-driven application using Azure Functions
4. **Microservices Architecture**: Deploy a containerized microservices application
5. **Landing Zone Implementation**: Set up a scalable, secure, and compliant Azure landing zone

## Skills Demonstrated

These projects showcase various Azure skills including:
- Resource provisioning and management
- Networking and security implementation
- Identity and access management
- DevOps and CI/CD pipelines
- Application deployment and scaling
- Data management and protection
- Monitoring and alerting
- Cost management
- Disaster recovery

## Prerequisites

Before attempting these projects, you should:
- Complete the AZ-900, AZ-104, and AZ-400 training sections
- Have an Azure subscription with appropriate permissions
- Possess basic knowledge of infrastructure, development, and operations
- Have the necessary tools installed (Azure CLI, PowerShell, Visual Studio Code, etc.)

## Getting Started

Each project is designed to be completed in sequence, with increasing complexity. Start with the Simple Web App project to establish foundational skills, then progress to more complex architectures as your comfort level increases.

Choose a project from the list above and follow the detailed implementation guide to build your own working solution in Azure.
