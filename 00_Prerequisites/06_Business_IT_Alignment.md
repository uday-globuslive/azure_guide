# Business and IT Alignment

This guide explains the essential business concepts related to IT and cloud computing, forming the foundation for understanding the business value of Azure services.

## Business Value of IT

### CapEx vs. OpEx Models

#### Capital Expenditure (CapEx)
- **Definition**: Major purchases that are used over the long term
- **Characteristics**:
  - Upfront investment
  - Depreciation over time
  - Fixed capacity planning
  - Limited flexibility
  - Tax treatment: depreciated over time
- **Traditional IT Examples**:
  - Data center facilities
  - Server hardware
  - Network equipment
  - Software licenses (perpetual)
  - Storage systems

#### Operational Expenditure (OpEx)
- **Definition**: Day-to-day expenses required for running the business
- **Characteristics**:
  - Pay-as-you-go model
  - No upfront investment
  - Flexible capacity
  - Responsive to business needs
  - Tax treatment: fully deductible in the year spent
- **Cloud IT Examples**:
  - Cloud service subscriptions
  - Consumption-based computing resources
  - SaaS licenses
  - Managed services
  - Support services

#### Business Impact of Shifting from CapEx to OpEx
- **Financial Benefits**:
  - Improved cash flow
  - Reduced financial risk
  - More predictable budgeting
  - Easier adjustment to changing business conditions
  - Faster procurement process
- **Operational Benefits**:
  - Faster deployment of new capabilities
  - Easier scaling up or down
  - Reduced maintenance overhead
  - Focus on business value rather than infrastructure

### Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

#### SLA Definition
A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a formal agreement between a service provider and customer that defines the level of service expected, including availability, performance, and responsibilities.

#### Key SLA Components
- **Service Description**: What services are covered
- **Performance Metrics**: Measurable criteria for service quality
- **Responsibilities**: What the provider and customer are each responsible for
- **Remedies**: Compensations if service levels aren't met
- **Exclusions**: Circumstances where the SLA doesn't apply
- **Reporting**: How service performance will be measured and reported

#### Common SLA Metrics
- **Availability**: Percentage of time a service is operational
  - Example: 99.9% uptime = approximately 8.76 hours of downtime per year
  - Common availability levels:
    - 99.9% ("three nines"): 8.76 hours/year downtime
    - 99.95%: 4.38 hours/year downtime
    - 99.99% ("four nines"): 52.56 minutes/year downtime
    - 99.999% ("five nines"): 5.26 minutes/year downtime
- **Response Time**: How quickly the service responds to requests
- **Throughput**: Amount of data processed in a given time
- **Error Rates**: Percentage of requests resulting in errors
- **Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)**: Average time to begin addressing issues
- **Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR)**: Average time to fix issues

#### Composite SLAs
- **Definition**: When multiple services are used together, their individual SLAs combine to form a composite SLA
- **Calculation**: Multiply the SLAs of dependent services
  - Example: Service A (99.9%) and Service B (99.9%) = 99.8% composite SLA
- **Series vs. Parallel**: Series connections multiply SLAs, parallel redundant connections can increase the composite SLA

#### Business Implications of SLAs
- **Risk Management**: Understanding potential business impact of outages
- **Cost vs. Reliability**: Higher SLAs typically cost more
- **Recovery Planning**: Developing strategies for potential service disruptions
- **Application Design**: Architecting for resilience based on SLA requirements
- **Vendor Evaluation**: Comparing providers based on service guarantees
