- Kanban
  - Visualizing workflow
  - Limiting work in progress (WIP)
  - Managing flow
  - Making process policies explicit
  - Implementing feedback loops
- Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)
  - Portfolio, Large Solution, Program, and Team levels
  - PI Planning
  - Value Streams

### Using Azure Boards for Agile Management
- Work item types (Epics, Features, User Stories, Tasks, Bugs)
- Boards, Backlogs, and Sprints
