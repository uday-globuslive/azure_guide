# Cloud Concepts (AZ-900)

## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet ("the cloud"), including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence.

## Cloud Computing Benefits

- **Cost-effective**: Pay only for services you use, reducing capital expenses
- **Scalable**: Scale resources up or down based on demand
- **Global reach**: Deploy applications globally in minutes
- **Reliable**: Data backup, disaster recovery, and business continuity
- **Secure**: Broad set of policies, technologies, and controls

## Types of Cloud Models

### Public Cloud
- Resources owned and operated by third-party cloud service provider
- Delivered over the internet
- Examples: Microsoft Azure, AWS, Google Cloud

### Private Cloud
- Cloud computing resources used exclusively by a single business or organization
- Can be located on-premises or hosted by a third-party service provider
- Greater control over resources and security

### Hybrid Cloud
- Combines public and private clouds
- Data and applications can move between private and public clouds
- Greater flexibility

## Types of Cloud Services

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Most basic category of cloud computing services
- Rent IT infrastructure (VMs, storage, networks, operating systems)
- Examples: Azure Virtual Machines, Azure Storage

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Provides environment for building, testing, and deploying software applications
- Resources needed to support the complete life cycle of building and delivering web apps
- Examples: Azure App Service, Azure SQL Database

### Software as a Service (SaaS)
- Complete software solution that you rent on a pay-as-you-go basis
- Users connect to and use cloud-based apps over the Internet
- Examples: Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365

## Consumption-Based Model

- Pay-as-you-go pricing
- No upfront costs
- No wasted resources
- Stop paying when you stop using

## Azure Global Infrastructure

- **Regions**: Geographical areas containing one or more data centers
- **Availability Zones**: Physically separate datacenters within an Azure region
- **Region Pairs**: Azure regions paired with another region for disaster recovery
- **Edge Locations**: Local endpoints for caching content for faster delivery

## Hands-On Exercise

1. Create a free Azure account
2. Explore the Azure portal
3. Identify available regions and services in your subscription
4. Use the Azure pricing calculator to estimate costs
