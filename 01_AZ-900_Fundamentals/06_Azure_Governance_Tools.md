## Introduction to Azure Governance

Azure Governance is a collection of mechanisms, processes, and tools that allow organizations to manage, secure, and optimize their Azure cloud environment. Proper governance helps:

- Ensure compliance with internal policies and external regulations
- Control costs and optimize resource utilization
- Maintain security and reduce risk
- Standardize deployments and configurations
- Enable organizational scaling in the cloud

Governance is essential for organizations of all sizes but becomes increasingly critical as cloud adoption expands.

## Azure Policy

Azure Policy is a service that allows you to create, assign, and manage policies that control or audit your resources.

### Key Features

- **Policy Definitions**: Rules that describe the desired state of your resources
- **Policy Assignments**: Application of policy definitions to specific scopes
- **Policy Parameters**: Variables that simplify policy reuse
- **Initiative Definitions**: Collections of policy definitions
- **Compliance Dashboard**: Visual reports of policy compliance

### Common Policies

1. **Allowed Resource Types**: Restrict which Azure resources can be deployed
   ```json
   {
     "properties": {
       "displayName": "Allowed resource types",
       "description": "This policy enables you to specify the resource types that your organization can deploy.",
       "parameters": {
         "listOfResourceTypesAllowed": {
           "type": "Array",
           "metadata": {
             "description": "The list of resource types that can be deployed.",
             "displayName": "Allowed resource types"
           }
         }
       },
       "policyRule": {
         "if": {
           "not": {
             "field": "type",
             "in": "[parameters('listOfResourceTypesAllowed')]"
           }
         },
         "then": {
           "effect": "deny"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Allowed Locations**: Restrict regions where resources can be deployed
   ```json
   {
     "properties": {
       "displayName": "Allowed locations",
       "description": "This policy enables you to restrict the locations your organization can deploy resources to.",
       "parameters": {
         "allowedLocations": {
           "type": "Array",
           "metadata": {
             "description": "The list of locations that can be specified when deploying resources.",
             "displayName": "Allowed locations"
           }
         }
       },
       "policyRule": {
         "if": {
           "not": {
             "field": "location",
             "in": "[parameters('allowedLocations')]"
           }
         },
         "then": {
           "effect": "deny"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Require Resource Tags**: Ensure resources have required tags
   ```json
   {
     "properties": {
       "displayName": "Require specified tag",
       "description": "Requires the specified tag.",
       "parameters": {
         "tagName": {
           "type": "String",
           "metadata": {
             "displayName": "Tag Name",
             "description": "Name of the tag, such as 'environment'"
           }
         }
       },
       "policyRule": {
         "if": {
           "field": "[concat('tags[', parameters('tagName'), ']')]",
           "exists": "false"
         },
         "then": {
           "effect": "deny"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

### Policy Effects

- **Deny**: Prevents resource creation or modification
- **Audit**: Creates a warning event but doesn't stop the operation
- **Append**: Adds information to the resource
- **DeployIfNotExists**: Deploys related resources if they don't exist
- **AuditIfNotExists**: Creates an audit event if a related resource doesn't exist
- **Modify**: Alters properties of a resource during creation or update

### Implementation Guide

1. Start with audit policies to understand impact
2. Create custom policies for organization-specific requirements
3. Use initiatives to group related policies
4. Assign policies at management group level for broad application
5. Monitor compliance and remediate non-compliant resources

## Azure Blueprints

Azure Blueprints enable you to define a repeatable set of Azure resources that implement and adhere to standards, patterns, and requirements.

### Blueprint Components

- **Resource Groups**: Container definitions for resources
- **ARM Templates**: Define the resources to deploy
- **Policy Assignments**: Apply Azure Policies
- **Role Assignments**: Apply RBAC permissions

### Blueprint Lifecycle

1. **Create**: Define the blueprint components
2. **Publish**: Make the blueprint available for assignment
3. **Assign**: Apply the blueprint to a subscription
4. **Track**: Monitor deployments and compliance

### Blueprint vs. ARM Templates

| Feature | Blueprint | ARM Template |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| Relationship tracking | Yes | No |
| Deployment sequencing | Yes | Limited |
| Locking | Yes | No |
| Assignment tracking | Yes | No |
| Policy assignment | Yes | Limited |
| Role assignment | Yes | Yes |

### Implementation Examples

1. **Compliant Environment Blueprint**:
   - Resource groups for workloads, networking, and security
   - Virtual network with subnets and NSGs
   - Log Analytics workspace
   - Security policies for regulatory compliance
   - Custom RBAC roles

2. **Multi-tier Application Blueprint**:
   - Web, application, and database tiers
   - Network security configurations
   - Monitoring and diagnostics
   - Backup and recovery settings

## Azure Management Groups

Management Groups provide a governance scope above subscriptions, allowing you to organize subscriptions into containers and apply governance conditions.

### Hierarchy Structure

- **Root Management Group**: Top-level container
- **Management Groups**: Organizational containers
- **Subscriptions**: Container for resources
- **Resource Groups**: Groupings of resources
- **Resources**: Individual services

### Key Features

- **Inheritance**: Policy and RBAC assignments flow down the hierarchy
- **Custom Hierarchy**: Up to six levels of depth (excluding root and subscription levels)
- **Flexible Organization**: Group by department, environment, geography, etc.

### Implementation Strategies

1. **Geographic Model**:
   ```
   Root
   ├── North America
   │   ├── US East
   │   └── US West
   └── Europe
       ├── EU West
       └── EU North
   ```

2. **Business Unit Model**:
   ```
   Root
   ├── Finance
   │   ├── Production
   │   └── Development
   └── IT
       ├── Production
       └── Development
   ```

3. **Environment Model**:
   ```
   Root
   ├── Production
   ├── Pre-Production
   ├── Development
   └── Sandbox
   ```

### Best Practices

- Limit management group depth to 3-4 levels for simplicity
- Apply broad policies at higher levels, specific policies at lower levels
- Use descriptive naming conventions
- Document your hierarchy design and governance approach
- Review and adjust the hierarchy as organization needs evolve

## Resource Locks

Resource locks prevent accidental deletion or modification of critical Azure resources.

### Lock Types

- **ReadOnly**: Prevents all modifications
- **CanNotDelete**: Allows modifications but prevents deletion

### Scope Levels

- **Subscription**: Applies to all resources in a subscription
- **Resource Group**: Applies to all resources in a resource group
- **Resource**: Applies to an individual resource

### Implementation Examples

1. **Database Lock**:
   ```azurecli
   az lock create --name LockDatabase --resource-group ExampleGroup --resource-name ExampleServer --resource-type Microsoft.Sql/servers --lock-type CanNotDelete
   ```

2. **Resource Group Lock**:
   ```azurecli
   az lock create --name LockResourceGroup --resource-group ExampleGroup --lock-type ReadOnly
   ```

### Best Practices

- Apply CanNotDelete locks to production resources
- Apply ReadOnly locks during maintenance windows
- Document all locks and their purposes
- Include lock removal in change management processes
- Use RBAC to control who can manage locks

## Azure Cost Management

Azure Cost Management helps you monitor, allocate, and optimize your Azure spending.

### Key Features

- **Cost Analysis**: Interactive dashboards for cost visualization
- **Budgets**: Set spending thresholds with alerts
- **Recommendations**: Get cost-saving suggestions
- **Exports**: Schedule regular exports of cost data
- **Cost Allocation**: Track costs by resource, tags, etc.

### Budget Types

- **Subscription Budget**: Track costs within a subscription
- **Resource Group Budget**: Track costs within a resource group
- **Management Group Budget**: Track costs across multiple subscriptions

### Cost Control Strategies

1. **Reserved Instances**: Pre-purchase compute capacity
2. **Azure Hybrid Benefit**: Use on-premises licenses
3. **Dev/Test Pricing**: Utilize lower rates for non-production
4. **Right-sizing**: Match resource size to workload
5. **Auto-shutdown**: Schedule VMs to stop during off-hours

### Governance with Cost Management

1. Create cost-conscious policies:
   ```json
   {
     "properties": {
       "displayName": "Not allowed resource types",
       "description": "Restrict expensive resource types",
       "parameters": {},
       "policyRule": {
         "if": {
           "field": "type",
           "in": [
             "Microsoft.HDInsight/clusters",
             "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/extensions"
           ]
         },
         "then": {
           "effect": "deny"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. Implement budget action groups for automated responses

## Tags

Tags are name-value pairs that help you organize and manage your Azure resources.

### Common Tag Categories

- **Environment**: Production, Development, Test, QA
- **Department**: Finance, Marketing, IT, HR
- **Cost Center**: Accounting codes for internal billing
- **Project**: Project name or identifier
- **Application**: Application name or identifier
- **Owner**: Team or individual responsible

### Tag Enforcement

1. **Require Tags Policy**:
   ```json
   {
     "properties": {
       "displayName": "Require specified tag on resource groups",
       "description": "Enforces existence of a tag on resource groups.",
       "parameters": {
         "tagName": {
           "type": "String",
           "metadata": {
             "displayName": "Tag Name",
             "description": "Name of the tag, such as 'environment'"
           }
         }
       },
       "policyRule": {
         "if": {
           "allOf": [
             {
               "field": "type",
               "equals": "Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups"
             },
             {
               "field": "[concat('tags[', parameters('tagName'), ']')]",
               "exists": "false"
             }
           ]
         },
         "then": {
           "effect": "deny"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Inherit Tags Policy**:
   ```json
   {
     "properties": {
       "displayName": "Inherit a tag from the resource group",
       "description": "Adds the specified tag with its value from the parent resource group when any resource is created or updated.",
       "parameters": {
         "tagName": {
           "type": "String",
           "metadata": {
             "description": "Name of the tag, such as 'environment'",
             "displayName": "Tag Name"
           }
         }
       },
       "policyRule": {
         "if": {
           "allOf": [
             {
               "field": "[concat('tags[', parameters('tagName'), ']')]",
               "exists": "false"
             }
           ]
         },
         "then": {
           "effect": "modify",
           "details": {
             "operations": [
               {
                 "operation": "add",
                 "field": "[concat('tags[', parameters('tagName'), ']')]",
                 "value": "[resourceGroup().tags[parameters('tagName')]]"
               }
             ],
             "roleDefinitionIds": [
               "/providers/microsoft.authorization/roleDefinitions/b24988ac-6180-42a0-ab88-20f7382dd24c"
             ]
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
